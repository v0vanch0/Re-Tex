# Re-Tex - supporting OctoTex
This tool will be heavily upgraded!

# DON'T INSTALL PYTHON 3.12, IT DOESN'T RUN ON IT!

### Take a look at [Kim's PBRify](https://github.com/Kim2091/PBRify_Upscaler) - this is used in Re-Tex for PBR generation and upscaling

## Description
This tool allows you to load captured textures from rtx remix, convert them to png, upscale with ESRGAN or RealESRGAN, generate octahedral normals, roughness, metalness maps, and write it back to the existing rtx remix mod, or create a new one ( recomended ). 

## AI PBR Models
You can download mixture of PBR models
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BsKeuFcdgMDxeTPq1jQAdc8FtXMLW-ea/view?usp=sharing" >here</a>
Put the old models to the
  1. OctoTex/ai/PBR/checkpoints/Dosplacement
  2. OctoTex/ai/PBR/checkpoints/Normal
  3. OctoTex/ai/PBR/checkpoints/Roughness
Folders!


## Steps
1. python webui.py      // That's it!

   
Good luck! :)
